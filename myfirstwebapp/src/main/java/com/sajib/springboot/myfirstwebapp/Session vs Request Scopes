Session vs Request Scopes

All requests from browser are handled by our web application deployed on a server

Request Scope: Active for a single request
	Once the response is sent back ,the request attributes will be removed from memory
	
	These cannot be used for future requests
	
	Recommended for most use cases
	
Session Scope: Details are stored across multiple requests
	Be careful about what you store in session (Takes additional memory as all details are stored on server).

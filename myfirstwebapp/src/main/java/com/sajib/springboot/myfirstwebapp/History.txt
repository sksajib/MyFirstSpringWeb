Peek into History:

Model 1 Arch.
All Code in views(Jsps,....)
	View logic
	Flow Logic
	Queries to databases
Disadvantages:
	very complex JSPs
	Zero separation of concerns
	Difficult to maintain
	
Model 2 Arch..
How about separating concerns?
	Model:data to generate the view
	View:Show information to user
	Controller:Controls the flow
Advantage: Simpler to maintain
Concern:
	Where to implement common features to all controllers?
	
	
Model 2 Arch- Front controller
Concept:all request flow into a central controller.
	Called as Front Controller
Front Controller controls flow to Controller's and Views's
	common features can be implemented in the Front controller.
	
Spring MVC Front controller- dispatcher Servlet
A:Receives HTTP Request.
B:Processes HTTP Request.
	B1:Identifies correct controller method
	    Based on request url
	B2:Executes Controller method
		Returns model and view Name
	B3:Identifies correct view
		Using ViewResolver
	B4:Executes view
C:returns HTTP Response
